# vim-hybrid-material
Material color scheme for Vim based on [w0ng/vim-hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) color scheme.

It includes **2 color schemes**:
* [Hybrid material](#hybrid-material) **(Only GVim/MacVim)**
* [Hybrid reverse](#hybrid-reverse)

Both schemes are almost similar to [w0ng/vim-hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid), just some colors are switched (Purple with red), to look more like tomorrow-night.

### Options
If you would like some of the code to be bolded, like functions and language controls, add this option to vimrc:

```vimL
let g:enable_bold_font = 1
```


#### Hybrid Material
Based on [equinusocio/material-theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

**NOTE:** Works **only for GVim/MacVim** at this moment.

```vimL
colorscheme hybrid_material
```

#### Hybrid Reverse
Original [w0ng/vim-hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid), with only colors switched.

colorscheme hybrid_reverse
```
